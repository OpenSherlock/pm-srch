      <title>Plant-Derived Exosomal Nanoparticles Inhibit Pathogenicity of Porphyromonas gingivalis.</title>
      <snippet>Plant exosomes protect plants against infection; however, whether edible plant exosomes can protect mammalian hosts against infection is not known. In this study, we show that ginger exosome-like nanoparticles (GELNs) are selectively taken up by the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis in a GELN phosphatidic acid (PA) dependent manner via interactions with hemin-binding protein 35 (HBP35) on the surface of P. gingivalis. Compared with PA (34:2), PA (34:1) did not interact with HBP35, indicating that the degree of unsaturation of PA plays a critical role in GELN-mediated interaction with HBP35. On binding to HBP35, pathogenic mechanisms of P. gingivalis were significantly reduced following interaction with GELN cargo molecules, including PA and miRs. These cargo molecules interacted with multiple pathogenic factors in the recipient bacteria simultaneously. Using edible plant exosome-like nanoparticles as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent/treat chronic periodontitis was further demonstrated in a mouse model.</snippet>

      <title>Increased hepatic FAT/CD36, PTP1B and decreased HNF4A expression contributes to dyslipidemia associated with ethanol-induced liver dysfunction: Rescue effect of ginger extract.</title>
      <snippet>The association between chronic alcohol consumption and the development of alcpholic liver disease is a very well known phenomenon, but the precise underlying molecular mediators involved in ethanol-induced liver disease remain elusive. This study aimed to characterize the lipid metabolism alterations and the molecular mediators which are related to lipid metabolism in liver under the heavy ethanol exposure alone or combined with ginger extract. Twenty-four male wistar rats were assigned into three groups, namely control, ethanol, and ginger extract treated ethanol (GETE) groups. Six weeks after the treatment, the ethanol group showed a significant increase in fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and decrease hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 Alpha (HNF4A) genes expressions compared to the control group. The ethanol administration also significantly increased plasma LDL, cholesterol, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared to the control group. Moreover, compared to the control group, the ethanol group showed liver histhological changes, such as fibrosis, focal microvesicular steatosis, some apoptotic hepatocytes, spotty necrosis, portal lymphocytic inflammation, mallory-denk bodies, giant mitochondria, piecemeal necrosis. Consumption of ginger extract along with ethanol, partially ameliorated gene expression alteration and histological changes, improved undesirable lipid profile and liver enzymes changes compare to those in the ethanol group. These findings indicate that ethanol-induced liver abnormalities may in part be associated with lipid homeostasis changes mediated by overexpression of FAT/CD36, PTP1B and downexpressionof HNF4A genes. It also show that these effects can be reduced by using ginger extract as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.</snippet>

      <title>Ginger extract diminishes chronic fructose consumption-induced kidney injury through suppression of renal overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines in rats.</title>
      <snippet>The metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of development and progression of chronic kidney disease. Renal inflammation is well known to play an important role in the initiation and progression of tubulointerstitial injury of the kidneys. Ginger, one of the most commonly used spices and medicinal plants, has been demonstrated to improve diet-induced metabolic abnormalities. However, the efficacy of ginger on the metabolic syndrome-associated kidney injury remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ginger on fructose consumption-induced adverse effects in the kidneys.</snippet>

      <title>Evaluation of the efficacy of ginger, Arabic gum, and Boswellia in acute and chronic renal failure.</title>
      <snippet>This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Ginger), Arabic gum (AG), and Boswellia on both acute and chronic renal failure (CRF) and the mechanisms underlying their effects. Acute renal failure was induced by 30 min ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion, while CRF was induced by adenine feeding for 8 weeks. Prophylactic oral administration of ginger, AG, Boswellia, or vehicle (in control groups) was started 3 days before and along with adenine feeding in different groups or 7 days before ischemia-reperfusion. Ginger and AG showed renoprotective effects in both models of renal failure. These protective effects may be attributed at least in part to their anti-inflammatory properties as evident by attenuating serum C-reactive protein levels and antioxidant effects as evident by attenuating lipid peroxidation marker, malondialdehyde levels, and increasing renal superoxide dismutase activity. Ginger was more potent than AG in both models of renal failure. However, Boswellia showed only partial protective effect against both acute renal failure and CRF and it had no antioxidant effects. Finally, we can say that ginger and AG could be beneficial adjuvant therapy in patients with acute renal failure and CRF to prevent disease progression and delay the need for renal replacement therapy.</snippet>

      <title>Modulation of age-related NF-kappaB activation by dietary zingerone via MAPK pathway.</title>
      <snippet>Zingerone, a major component found in ginger root, has been known as anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic activities that are often associated with its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. In recent studies, we examined molecular mechanism of zingerone treatment on pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB activation via the redox-related NIK/IKK and MAPK pathways. Action mechanism of zingerone on NF-kappaB signaling was investigated in aged rat kidney and endothelial cells. The results showed that zingerone had not only the antioxidant effect by constitutive suppression of ROS, but also anti-inflammatory effects by suppression of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in aged rat. In addition, zingerone treatment suppressed gene activation of pro-inflammatory enzymes, COX-2 and iNOS, which were upregulated with aging through NF-kappaB activation and IKK/MAPK signaling pathway. These experiments strongly indicate that zingerone treatment exerts a beneficial efficacy by suppressing both oxidative stress and age-related inflammation through the modulation of several key pro-inflammatory genes and transcription factors. Thus, the significance of our findings is that the zingerone treatment may provide some preventive measure against chronic inflammatory conditions that underlie many age-related inflammatory diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, dementia, arthritis, diabetes, osteoprosis, and cancers.</snippet>

      <title>Notes from the CKD kitchen: a variety of salt-free seasonings.</title>
      <snippet>One of the challenges with renal diets is how to make flavorful food while maintaining the low sodium restrictions. I have found three spice companies that have created seasoning mixtures using a mixture of herbs that do not add sodium or potassium chloride in their flavors. The recipe Ginger Roasted Chicken with an Asian Slaw is an example of how you can use three different salt-free seasonings to create a flavorful meal. I know from personal experience that I feel better, have more energy, and sleep better if I restrict my sodium intake. It is easy to stop using the salt shaker and replace the garlic salt and onion salt with garlic powder and onion powder in the kitchen. It takes a dedicated shopper to find the hidden sodium in foods. I find myself reading more and more labels in the aisles of the grocery store before I put any foods in my grocery cart. I also find myself studying the spice selections looking for salt-free seasonings. Mrs. Dash is great and very popular, but there must be more options for us patients with chronic kidney disease. After doing some culinary research, I was pleased to find a much larger section of salt-free seasonings than I expected. I have listed a few of the seasoning combinations below and a table of three major spice companies along with their contact information for purchasing their products.</snippet>
