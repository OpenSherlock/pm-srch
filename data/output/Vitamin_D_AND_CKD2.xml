      <title>Vitamin K deficiency: an emerging player in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and an iatrogenic consequence of therapies in advanced renal disease.</title>
      <snippet> vitamin D decrease. These imbalances have been linked to the development of vascular calcification. More recently, additional factors have been found to play a role in vascular calcification. Matrix G1a protein (MGP) in its carboxylated form (cMGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. Importantly, carboxylation of MGP is dependent on the cofactor vitamin K. In patients with CKD, vitamin K deficiency is prevalent and is exacerbated by warfarin, which is frequently used for anticoagulation. Insufficient bioavailability of vitamin K reduces the amount of cMGP available, and, therefore, it may lead to increased risk of vascular calcification. In vitro studies have shown that in the setting of a high-phosphate environment and vitamin K antagonism, human aortic valve interstitial cells become calcified. In this article, we discuss the pathophysiological consequence of vitamin K deficiency in the setting of altered mineral and bone metabolism, its prevalence, and clinical implications in patients with CKD.</snippet>

The commentary committee co-chairs selected potential members based on their knowledge of the Canadian kidney community, aiming for wide representation from relevant disciplines, academic and community centers, and different geographical regions. ... We agreed with many of the recommendations in the clinical practice guideline on the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD. However, based on the uncommon occurrence of abnormalities in calcium and phosphate and the low likelihood of severe abnormalities in parathyroid hormone (PTH), we recommend against screening and monitoring levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH, and alkaline phosphatase in adults with CKD G3. We suggest and recommend monitoring these parameters in adults with CKD G4 and G5, respectively. In children, we agree that monitoring for CKD-MBD should begin in CKD G2, but we suggest measuring ionized calcium, rather than total calcium or calcium adjusted for albumin. With regard to vitamin D, we suggest against routine screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults with CKD G3-G5 and G1T-G5T and suggest following population health recommendations for adequate vitamin D intake. We recommend that the measurement and management of bone mineral density (BMD) be according to general population guidelines in CKD G3 and G3T, but we suggest against routine BMD testing in CKD G4-G5, CKD G4T-5T, and in children with CKD. Based on insufficient data, we also recommend against routine bone biopsy in clinical practice for adults with CKD or CKD-T, or in children with CKD, although we consider it an important research tool. ...

      <snippet>CKD-MBD (chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disorder) describes a complex syndrome of renal osteodystrophy, mineral disturbances and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present articles intends to provide an up-to-date summary of recent clinically important developments in the field of CKD-MBD. The article touches specifically phosphate management, secondary hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D, arteriosclerosis, renal bone disease, and SGLT2-inhibitors. The summary also comments on which grade of evidence novel aspects and innovative developments in CKD-BMD are based. The author concludes that nephrologists should strive after more high-quality, large-scale randomized-controlled interventional trials in order to optimize the evidence behind CKD-MBD therapy.</snippet>

      <title>Endothelial Dysfunction in Chronic Kidney Disease, from Biology to Clinical Outcomes: A 2020 Update.</title>
      <snippet>The vascular endothelium is a dynamic, functionally complex organ, modulating multiple biological processes, including vascular tone and permeability, inflammatory responses, thrombosis, and angiogenesis. Endothelial dysfunction is a threat to the integrity of the vascular system, and it is pivotal in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with this disturbance being almost universal in patients who reach the most advanced phase of CKD, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Low NO bioavailability in CKD depends on several mechanisms affecting the expression and the activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Accumulation of endogenous inhibitors of eNOS, inflammation and oxidative stress, advanced glycosylation products (AGEs), bone mineral balance disorders encompassing hyperphosphatemia, high levels of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and low levels of the active form of vitamin D (1,25 vitamin D) and the anti-ageing vasculoprotective factor Klotho all impinge upon NO bioavailability and are critical to endothelial dysfunction in CKD. Wide-ranging multivariate interventions are needed to counter endothelial dysfunction in CKD, an alteration triggering arterial disease and cardiovascular complications in this high-risk population.</snippet>

      <snippet>Perturbations in phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis impacts skeletal health in children and adults. Study of inherited and acquired hypophosphatemic syndromes led to the discovery of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) as a potent regulator of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism, and advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of mineral and bone disorder in chronic kidney disease (CKD-MBD). Here, we review a recently approved therapy for patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) using a novel anti-FGF23 antibody, burosumab, and discuss the implications of such targeted therapy in CKD. ... In children and adults with XLH, burosumab treatment significantly increased renal tubular phosphate reabsorption and normalized serum phosphorus concentrations. Prolonged treatment with burosumab showed a favorable safety profile, improved healing of rickets in children, and fractures and pseudofractures in adults. FGF23 excess in CKD is independently associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular mortality. Research strategies to lower FGF23 in animal models of CKD are rapidly advancing and a question that remains to be answered is whether FGF23 blockade will offer a new targeted intervention for disordered mineral metabolism in CKD. ... Findings from recently concluded clinical trials in adults and children with XLH provide evidence for improved skeletal health with burosumab therapy with normalization of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. Targeted anti-FGF23 antibody treatment of XLH has emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat an inherited disorder of FGF23 excess.</snippet>

      <title>Inhibition of Osteoclast Differentiation by 1.25-D and the Calcimimetic KP2326 Reveals 1.25-D Resistance in Advanced CKD.</title>
      <snippet>Active vitamin D analogs and calcimimetics are the main therapies used for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 19 pediatric patients with CKD1-5D and 6 healthy donors (HD) were differentiated into mature osteoclasts with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The effects of single or combined treatment with active vitamin D (1.25-D) and/or calcimimetic KP2326 were evaluated on osteoclastic differentiation and osteoclastic-mediated bone resorption. Although 1.25-D inhibited osteoclastic differentiation, a significant resistance to 1.25-D was observed when glomerular filtration rate decreased. A significant albeit less important inhibitory effect of KP2326 on osteoclastic differentiation was also found both in cells derived from HD and CKD patients, through a putative activation of the Erk pathway. This inhibitory effect was not modified by CKD stage. Combinatorial treatment with 1.25-D and KP2326 did not result in synergistic effects. Last, KP2326 significantly inhibited osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Both 1.25-D and KP2326 inhibit osteoclastic differentiation, however, to a different extent. There is a progressive resistance to 1.25-D in advanced CKD that is not found with KP2326. KP2326 also inhibits bone resorption. Given that 1.25-D has no effect on osteoclastic resorption activity and that calcimimetics also have direct anabolic effects on osteoblasts, there is an experimental rationale that could favor the use of decreased doses of 1.25-D with low doses of calcimimetics in SHPT in dialysis to improve the underlying osteodystrophy. However, this last point deserves confirmatory clinical studies. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</snippet>

The study included 264 patients with COPD of 2-4 degrees of severity in combination with CKD of 1-2 stages: 135 patients of the main group and 129 patients of the control group. Each group was divided into 4 subgroups according to the value of FEV1 and vitamin D level. In the main group, the native vitamin D was prescribed according to the scheme providing maintenance of vitamin D level &gt;34,3 ng/ml during the year, in the control group - according to the recommendations of the Russian Association of Endocrinologists. An ultrasound of the kidneys with the calculation of the resistance index (RI) and albuminuria level were carried out in all patients at inclusion into the study and after its completion. A decrease in the severity of albuminuria from A3 to A2 was revealed in 24,1% (16), and an increase in GFR - in 42,9% (58) patients of all patients in the main group.

Our data suggest that the true hypocalcemia incidence after using albumin-corrected calcium values is very low in patients receiving IPCI, even in the presence of calcium altering factors. The percentage of patients with hypocalcemia is much higher and similar to the KEYNOTE-189 and CHECKMATE-067 trials when serum calcium values without albumin correction are used. Thus, the higher reported incidence of hypocalcemia in these trials is likely due to the reporting of serum calcium without albumin correction.</snippet>
