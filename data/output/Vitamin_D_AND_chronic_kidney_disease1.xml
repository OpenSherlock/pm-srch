      <title>Circulating Levels of Dickkopf-Related Protein 1 Decrease as Measured GFR Declines and Are Associated with PTH Levels.</title>
      <snippet>The Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been implicated in the development of adynamic bone disease in early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) and sclerostin are antagonists of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway yet have not been widely used as clinical indicators of bone disease. This study characterized levels of DKK1, sclerostin, and other biomarkers of mineral metabolism in participants across a spectrum of inulin-measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). ... GFR was measured by urinary inulin clearance (mGFR) in 90 participants. Blood samples were obtained for measurement of circulating DKK1, sclerostin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphate, α-klotho, and vitamin D metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Spearman correlations and linear regressions were used where appropriate to examine the associations between measured values. ... The median [IQR] age was 64 years [53.0-71.0], and the median [IQR] mGFR was 32.6 [21.7-60.6] mL/min. DKK1 decreased (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.001) and sclerostin increased (r = -0.4, p &lt; 0.001) as kidney function declined, and both were associated with phosphate, PTH, FGF-23, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the unadjusted analysis. After adjustment for age and mGFR, DKK1 remained significantly associated with PTH. ... The results of this study demonstrate opposing trends in Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors, DKK1 and sclerostin, as mGFR declines. Unlike sclerostin, DKK1 levels decreased significantly as mGFR declined and was independently associated with PTH. Future studies should determine whether measurement of Wnt signaling inhibitors may be useful in predicting bone histomorphometric findings and important clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Association of vitamin D deficiency with arterial stiffness in newly diagnosed hypertension.</title>
      <snippet>Vitamin D has beneficial effects on vascular endothelial function, blood pressure (BP) and arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness increases in early-stage hypertensive patients and it is a strong predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) levels and arterial stiffness in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension.</snippet>

      <title>New Aspects of the Kidney in the Regulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) and Mineral Homeostasis.</title>
      <snippet>The bone-derived hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) acts in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the active vitamin D metabolite calcitriol in the regulation of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) homeostasis. More factors are being identified to regulate FGF23 levels and the endocrine loops between the three hormones. The present review summarizes the complex regulation of FGF23 and the disturbed FGF23/Klotho system in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to the reduced ability of the injured kidney to regulate plasma levels of FGF23, several CKD-related factors have been shown to stimulate FGF23 production. The high circulating FGF23 levels have detrimental effects on erythropoiesis, the cardio-vascular system and the immune system, all contributing to the disturbed system biology in CKD. Moreover, new factors secreted by the injured kidney and the uremic calcified vasculature play a role in the mineral and bone disorder in CKD and create a vicious pathological crosstalk.</snippet>

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 23-Klotho and hypertension: experimental and clinical mechanisms.</title>
      <snippet>Hypertension (HTN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized in pediatric patients and represent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. In CKD, enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption is a leading cause of HTN due to augmented extracellular fluid volume expansion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) upregulates various tubular sodium cotransporters that are also targets of the hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and its co-receptor Klotho. FGF23 inhibits the activation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D that is a potent suppressor of renin biosynthesis. Here we review the complex interactions and disturbances of the FGF23-Klotho axis, vitamin D, and the RAAS relevant to blood pressure regulation and discuss the therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating their pathophysiologic contributions to HTN.</snippet>

      <snippet>Novel ways of determining cardiovascular risk are needed as a consequence of population ageing and the increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), both of which favour vascular calcification. Since the formation of arterial calcium deposits has a genetic component, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could predict cardiovascular events.</snippet>

      <title>Maxacalcitol (22-Oxacalcitriol (OCT)) Retards Progression of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy with Renal Dysfunction Through Inhibition of Calcineurin-NFAT Activity.</title>
      <snippet>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a cardiovascular complication highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Previous studies analyzing 1α-hydroxylase or vitamin D receptor (Vdr) knockout mice revealed active vitamin D as a promising agent inhibiting LVH progression. Paricalcitol, an active vitamin D analog, failed to suppress the progression of LV mass index (LVMI) in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. As target genes of activated VDR differ depending on its agonists, we examined the effects of maxacalcitol (22-oxacalcitriol: OCT), a less calcemic active vitamin D analog, on LVH in hemodialysis patients and animal LVH models with renal insufficiency.</snippet>

      <title>Recurrent Pleural Effusions and Elevated PTHrP: An Unusual Case of Sarcoidosis.</title>
      <snippet>A 63-year-old male with a past medical history of stage 3 chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease presented with recurrent symptomatic pleural effusions, low back pain and unintentional weight loss. Labs revealed elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone-related peptide, but normal parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. Malignancy workup was revealing for salt-and-pepper appearance of the bone marrow on MRI of the lumbar spine consistent with multiple myeloma. CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for neoplastic process but showed a pleural effusion and calcified granulomas in hilar lymph nodes. Bone marrow biopsy of the lumbar region was subsequently conducted and revealed granulomas confirming the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Treatment of sarcoidosis resulted in complete resolution of his symptoms and pleural effusion. This case highlights the variable presentation of sarcoidosis and its ability to mimic malignancy. Prompt recognition and treatment is essential in avoiding unnecessary costs and harm to the patient.</snippet>

      <title>Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorders: Pathogenesis and Management.</title>
      <snippet>The key players of the chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are calcium, phosphate, PTH, FGF23, and the vitamin D hormonal system. The progressive reduction of kidney function greatly modifies the tightly interrelated mechanisms that control these parameters. As a result, important changes occur in the bone and mineral hormonal axis, leading to changes in bone turnover with relevant consequences in clinical outcomes, such as decrease in bone mass with increased bone fragility and bone fractures and increased vascular and valvular calcification, also with great impact in the cardiovascular outcomes. So far, the knowledge of the mineral and bone disorders in CKD and the increased variety of efficacious therapies should lead to a better prevention and management of CKD-MBD.</snippet>

      <title>Sclerostin and osteoprotegerin: new markers of chronic kidney disease mediated mineral and bone disease in children.</title>
      <snippet>Background Sclerostin and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are new markers of chronic kidney disease (CKD) mediated mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) which were extensively evaluated in adult population. We aimed to evaluate the associations between serum levels of sclerostin/OPG and parameters of bone turnover and compare the serum levels of sclerostin/OPG in different stages of CKD in children. Methods 70 children with CKD stage 1-5, aged 2-21 years were examined. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, total calcium, phosphorus , intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and vitamin D were measured. Serum sclerostin and OPG levels were measured in children with different levels of CKD stage and their association with bone turnover parameters were noted. Results We did not observe any significant correlation between serum levels of sclerostin and OPG and stages of CKD. A negative relationship was present between serum sclerostin and 25-OH vitamin D levels. Osteoprotegerin was positively and significantly correlated with ALP but serum sclerostin was negatively correlated with ALP. Conclusion Our study, which includes only children and adolescents with a growing skeleton under uremic conditions and excluding diabetes and atherosclerosis interference, is very valuable. We couldn&apos;t find any significant relationship between either sclerostin or OPG levels among different stages of CKD. Also our study demonstared a strong negative relationship between ALP and sclerostin levels and a strong positive relationship between ALP and OPG levels, reminding the importance of ALP levels to predict the bone-mineral status of the children with CKD.</snippet>
