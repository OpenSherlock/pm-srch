      <title>Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorders: Pathogenesis and Management.</title>
      <snippet>The key players of the chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are calcium, phosphate, PTH, FGF23, and the vitamin D hormonal system. The progressive reduction of kidney function greatly modifies the tightly interrelated mechanisms that control these parameters. As a result, important changes occur in the bone and mineral hormonal axis, leading to changes in bone turnover with relevant consequences in clinical outcomes, such as decrease in bone mass with increased bone fragility and bone fractures and increased vascular and valvular calcification, also with great impact in the cardiovascular outcomes. So far, the knowledge of the mineral and bone disorders in CKD and the increased variety of efficacious therapies should lead to a better prevention and management of CKD-MBD.</snippet>

      <title>Patient acceptability of targeted risk-based detection of non-communicable diseases in a dental and pharmacy setting.</title>
      <snippet>Non-communicable diseases [NCDs] are the major cause of mortality globally and are increasing in prevalence. Different healthcare professionals&apos; access different population groups; and engaging allied healthcare professionals in risk-driven early case detection of certain NCDs may be beneficial, especially those who have not been tested for NCDs within the previous 12 months. The objectives of this study were to determine: whether NCD case finding in dental/community pharmacy settings is feasible in terms of patient acceptability, barriers to recruitment, impact on the existing service. Determine time taken to test for: type 2 diabetes risk [T2DM], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], hypertension, vitamin D deficiency and chronic kidney disease [CKD]. Determine whether there is added benefit of point of care testing [POCT] to identify diabetes risk compared to a validated screening questionnaire alone.</snippet>

      <title>Sclerostin and osteoprotegerin: new markers of chronic kidney disease mediated mineral and bone disease in children.</title>
      <snippet>Background Sclerostin and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are new markers of chronic kidney disease (CKD) mediated mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) which were extensively evaluated in adult population. We aimed to evaluate the associations between serum levels of sclerostin/OPG and parameters of bone turnover and compare the serum levels of sclerostin/OPG in different stages of CKD in children. Methods 70 children with CKD stage 1-5, aged 2-21 years were examined. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, total calcium, phosphorus , intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and vitamin D were measured. Serum sclerostin and OPG levels were measured in children with different levels of CKD stage and their association with bone turnover parameters were noted. Results We did not observe any significant correlation between serum levels of sclerostin and OPG and stages of CKD. A negative relationship was present between serum sclerostin and 25-OH vitamin D levels. Osteoprotegerin was positively and significantly correlated with ALP but serum sclerostin was negatively correlated with ALP. Conclusion Our study, which includes only children and adolescents with a growing skeleton under uremic conditions and excluding diabetes and atherosclerosis interference, is very valuable. We couldn&apos;t find any significant relationship between either sclerostin or OPG levels among different stages of CKD. Also our study demonstared a strong negative relationship between ALP and sclerostin levels and a strong positive relationship between ALP and OPG levels, reminding the importance of ALP levels to predict the bone-mineral status of the children with CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Linking chronic kidney disease and Parkinson&apos;s disease: a literature review.</title>
      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been typically implicated in cardiovascular risk, considering the function the kidney has related to blood pressure, vitamin D, red blood cell metabolism, and electrolyte and acid-base regulation. However, neurological consequences are also attributed to this disease. Among these, recent large epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased risk for Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) in patients with CKD. Multiple studies have evaluated individually the association of blood pressure, vitamin D, and red blood cell dysmetabolism with PD, however, no study has reviewed the potential mechanisms related to these components in context of CKD and PD. In this review, we explored the association of CKD and PD and linked the components of the former to propose potential pathways explaining a future increased risk for PD, where renin-angiotensin system, oxidative stress, and inflammation have a main role. Potential preventive and therapeutic interventions based on these associations are also explored. More preclinical studies are needed to confirm the potential link of CKD conditions and future PD risk, whereas more interventional studies targeting this association are warranted to confirm their potential benefit in PD.</snippet>

      <title>Klotho, Aging, and the Failing Kidney.</title>
      <snippet>Klotho has been recognized as a gene involved in the aging process in mammals for over 30 years, where it regulates phosphate homeostasis and the activity of members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. The α-Klotho protein is the receptor for Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23), regulating phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism. Phosphate toxicity is a hallmark of mammalian aging and correlates with diminution of Klotho levels with increasing age. As such, modulation of Klotho activity is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in the diseasome of aging; in particular for chronic kidney disease (CKD), where Klotho has been implicated directly in the pathophysiology. A range of senotherapeutic strategies have been developed to directly or indirectly influence Klotho expression, with varying degrees of success. These include administration of exogenous Klotho, synthetic and natural Klotho agonists and indirect approaches, via modulation of the foodome and the gut microbiota. All these approaches have significant potential to mitigate loss of physiological function and resilience accompanying old age and to improve outcomes within the diseasome of aging.</snippet>

      <title>Relationship between GFR, intact PTH, oxidized PTH, non-oxidized PTH as well as FGF23 in patients with CKD.</title>
      <snippet>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are regulators of renal phosphate excretion and vitamin D metabolism. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), circulating FGF23 and PTH concentrations progressively increase as renal function declines. Oxidation of PTH at two methionine residues (positions 8 and 18) causes a loss of function. The impact of n-oxPTH and oxPTH on FGF23 synthesis, however, and how n-oxPTH and oxPTH concentrations are affected by CKD, is yet unknown. The effects of oxidized and non-oxidized PTH 1-34 on Fgf23 gene expression were analyzed in UMR106 osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between n-oxPTH and oxPTH, respectively, with FGF23 in two independent patients&apos; cohorts (620 children with CKD and 600 kidney transplant recipients). While n-oxPTH stimulated Fgf23 mRNA synthesis in vitro, oxidation of PTH in particular at Met8 led to a markedly weaker stimulation of Fgf23. The effect was even stronger when both Met8 and Met18 were oxidized. In both clinical cohorts, n-oxPTH-but not oxPTH-was significantly associated with FGF23 concentrations, independent of known confounding factors. Moreover, with progressive deterioration of kidney function, intact PTH (iPTH) and oxPTH increased substantially, whereas n-oxPTH increased only moderately. In conclusion, n-oxPTH, but not oxPTH, stimulates Fgf23 gene expression. The increase in PTH with decreasing GFR is mainly due to an increase in oxPTH in more advanced stages of CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Osteoporosis in Patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases: A Systemic Review.</title>
      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with the development of mineral bone disorder (MBD), osteoporosis, and fragility fractures. Among CKD patients, adynamic bone disease or low bone turnover is the most common type of renal osteodystrophy. The consequences of CKD-MBD include increased fracture risk, greater morbidity, and mortality. Thus, the goal is to prevent the occurrences of fractures by means of alleviating CKD-induced MBD and treating subsequent osteoporosis. Changes in mineral and humoral metabolism as well as bone structure develop early in the course of CKD. CKD-MBD includes abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and/or vitamin D; abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength; and/or vascular or other soft tissue calcification. In patients with CKD-MBD, using either DXA or FRAX to screen fracture risk should be considered. Biomarkers such as bALP and iPTH may assist to assess bone turnover. Before initiating an antiresorptive or anabolic agent to treat osteoporosis in CKD patients, lifestyle modifications, such as exercise, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation, smoking cessation, and avoidance of excessive alcohol intake are important. Managing hyperphosphatemia and SHPT are also crucial. Understanding the complex pathogenesis of CKD-MBD is crucial in improving one&apos;s short- and long-term outcomes. Treatment strategies for CKD-associated osteoporosis should be patient-centered to determine the type of renal osteodystrophy. This review focuses on the mechanism, evaluation and management of patients with CKD-MBD. However, further studies are needed to explore more details regarding the underlying pathophysiology and to assess the safety and efficacy of agents for treating CKD-MBD.</snippet>

      <title>Celastrol attenuates arterial and valvular calcification via inhibiting BMP2/Smad1/5 signalling.</title>
      <snippet>Vascular calcification is an important risk factor for the mortality and morbidity in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, until now there is no certain medication targeting vascular calcification in CKD. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effect of celastrol on high calcium-induced vascular calcification and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Cell proliferation assay showed that celastrol inhibited aortic valve interstitial cell (VIC) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation when its concentration was higher than 0.6 μmol/L. 0.8 μmol/L celastrol inhibited the expression of osteogenic genes and calcium deposition induced by high-calcium medium in both AVICs and VSMCs. In mouse vascular calcification model induced by adenine combined with vitamin D, alizarin red and immunostaining showed that celastrol inhibited pro-calcification gene expression and calcium deposition in aortic wall and aortic valve tissues. At the molecular level, celastrol inhibited the increase of BMP2, phosphorylated Smad1/5 (p-Smad1/5) and non-phosphorylated β-catenin (n-p-β-catenin) induced by high-calcium medium both in vitro and in vivo. Also, BMP2 overexpression reversed the anti-calcification effects of celastrol by recovering the decrease of p-Smad1/5 and n-p-β-catenin. Furthermore, celastrol prevented the up-regulation of BMPRII and down-regulation of Smad6 induced by high calcium, and this protectory effect can be abolished by BMP2 overexpression. In conclusion, our data for the first time demonstrate that celastrol attenuates high calcium-induced arterial and valvular calcification by inhibiting BMP2/Smad1/5 signalling, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for arterial and valvular calcification in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Recent advances in understanding and managing secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease.</title>
      <snippet>Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a complex pathology that develops as chronic kidney disease progresses. The retention of phosphorus and the reductions in calcium and vitamin D levels stimulate the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone as well as the proliferation rate of parathyroid cells. Parathyroid growth is initially diffuse but it becomes nodular as the disease progresses, making the gland less susceptible to be inhibited. Although the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism are well known, new evidence has shed light on unknown aspects of the deregulation of parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is an important feature of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder and plays an important role in the development of bone disease and vascular calcification. Thus, part of the management of chronic kidney disease relies on maintaining acceptable levels of mineral metabolism parameters in an attempt to slow down or prevent the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Here, we will also review the latest evidence regarding several aspects of the clinical and surgical management of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</snippet>

Plasma trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)-a gut microbe-dependent metabolite of dietary L-carnitine and choline-is elevated in CKD and related to vascular disease, resulting in poorer long-term survival. Therefore, the modulation of colonic flora can improve prospects for patients with CKD. Managing metabolic syndrome, anemia, and abnormal mineral metabolism is recommended for the prevention of CVD in patients with CKD. Considering nontraditional risk factors, the use of resveratrol (RSV), a nutraceutical, can be helpful for patients with CVD and CKD. This paper discusses the beneficial effects of RSV on biologic, pathophysiological and clinical responses, including improvements in intestinal epithelial integrity, modulation of the intestinal microbiota and reduction in hepatic synthesis of IS, PCS and TMAO in patients with CVD and CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Vitamin D ameliorates adipose browning in chronic kidney disease cachexia.</title>
      <snippet> in CKD mice. Vitamin D repletion stimulated appetite, normalized weight gain, and improved fat and lean mass content in CKD mice. Vitamin D supplementation attenuated expression of key molecules involved in adipose tissue browning and ameliorated expression of thermogenic genes in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in CKD mice. Furthermore, repletion of vitamin D improved skeletal muscle fiber size and in vivo muscle function, normalized muscle collagen content and attenuated muscle fat infiltration as well as pathogenetic molecular pathways related to muscle mass regulation in CKD mice. RNAseq analysis was performed on the gastrocnemius muscle. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the top 12 differentially expressed genes in CKD were correlated with impaired muscle and neuron regeneration, enhanced muscle thermogenesis and fibrosis. Importantly, vitamin D repletion normalized the expression of those 12 genes in CKD mice. Vitamin D repletion may be an effective therapeutic strategy for adipose tissue browning and muscle wasting in CKD patients.</snippet>
