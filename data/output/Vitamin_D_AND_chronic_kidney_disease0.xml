      <title>Graft survival effect of HLA-A allele matching parathyroid allotransplantation.</title>
      <snippet>Permanent hypoparathyroidism is an endocrine disease that is mostly associated with the disruption of the parathyroid glands during surgery. Allotransplantation is the most promising approach for treatment particularly for its cost-effective and exact curative potential. Herein our aim was to evaluate human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A allele matching effect on clinical improvement and graft survival after parathyroid transplantation. We performed parathyroid transplantation between ABO/Rh compatible recipient and an unrelated donor who has chronic kidney disease. Preoperative immunological tests include panel reactive antibody, T-flow cytometry crossmatch, B-flow cytometry crossmatch, autoflow cytometry crossmatch, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch tests were performed. After histopathological evaluation, half of the resected parathyroid gland cells were isolated and transplanted to the omentum surface by laparoscopy. The transplantation outcome was followed up throughout 382 days. The recipient discharged 2 days after transplantation without any complication. During follow-up, calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduced to a one-third dose; even the intact PTH levels remained low. However, clinical improvement was observed by serum calcium levels. The recipient still continues with low-dose supplementation after 382 days of post-transplantation. Parathyroid cell transplantation to the omental tissue is the most promising option even with only one allele matching for patients with using lifelong high-dose supplementation. Clinical improvements and long-term effect of HLA-A allele matching should be evaluated with more studies and in larger cohorts as well.</snippet>

      <title>Diabetes Mellitus and Renal Function: Current Medical Research and Opinion.</title>
      <snippet>Diabetes mellitus (DM) which is defined as high blood glucose level is a major public health worldwide. While discussing DM, the knowledge in this field is unlimited hence a syndrome that populations are living with for more than a decade is always an important matter to keep searching for updates on it. Challenges are always present in different means as comorbidities, poorly controlled DM especially type 2 Diabetes mellitus(T2DM) is considered as a risk factor for a lot of different diseases including but not limited to chronic kidney Disease (CKD). Complications might appear through time, as the aging process changes the body functions, while a significant number of antidiabetic medications are cleared eventually by the kidney; this increase the burden on kidney function placing the diabetic patients at risk. The significant high number of patients with uncontrolled diabetes resulting with kidney disease mirror the importance of this condition on patient&apos;s quality of life. This review presents an overview, pathophysiology, etiology and prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and abnormal renal parameters correlated with poorly controlled T2DM, with emphasis on and clinical studies involving the association between vitamin D Insufficiency/Deficiency and chronic kidney disease among patients with T2DM.</snippet>

      <title>Active vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 infections: review.</title>
      <snippet>SARS-CoV-2, causing the lethal disease COVid-19, is a public health emergency in the 2020 global pandemic. The outbreak and fast spreading of SARS-CoV-2 have a high morbidity and mortality specifically in elder patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and organ transplanted patients with immunosuppressive therapy. Preliminary results support different treatments such as chloroquine and convalescent plasma infusion in severe cases, with good outcome. On the other hand, the efficacy of supplementation with active vitamin D, an immunomodulator hormone with antiinflammatory and antimicrobial effects, is unproven. A recent study reported that vitamin D attains antiviral effects, via blocking viral replication directly. SARS-CoV-2 primarily uses the immune evasion process during infection via the envelope spike glycoprotein, which is followed by a cytokine storm, causing severe acute respiratory disease syndrome and death. SARS-CoV-2, by using the well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by the protein spike, as the host receptor to enter into alveolar, myocardial, and renal epithelial cells, can be disrupted by vitamin D. However, the correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 deaths in previous studies was insignificant. Retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find this correlation. Studies have shown that, vitamin D reduces the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia via direct inhibition of viral replication, antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The data available today regarding the beneficial protective effect of vitamin D is unclear and with conflicting results. Large randomized control trials are necessary to test this hypothesis. In this review, we will explain the cross talk between the active vitamin D and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and summarize the data from the literature.</snippet>

      <title>Fibrosis in Chronic Kidney Disease: Pathogenesis and Consequences.</title>
      <snippet>Fibrosis is a process characterized by an excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix as a response to different types of tissue injuries, which leads to organ dysfunction. The process can be initiated by multiple and different stimuli and pathogenic factors which trigger the cascade of reparation converging in molecular signals responsible of initiating and driving fibrosis. Though fibrosis can play a defensive role, in several circumstances at a certain stage, it can progressively become an uncontrolled irreversible and self-maintained process, named pathological fibrosis. Several systems, molecules and responses involved in the pathogenesis of the pathological fibrosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be discussed in this review, putting special attention on inflammation, renin-angiotensin system (RAS), parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), Klotho, microRNAs (miRs), and the vitamin D hormonal system. All of them are key factors of the core and regulatory pathways which drive fibrosis, having a great negative kidney and cardiac impact in CKD.</snippet>

Tubular dysfunction, tubular damage, kidney stones, and inadequate urinary acidification were all observed, suggesting the presence of renal tubular acidosis from a combination of both distal and proximal origin. She also had overt proteinuria, decreased renal function, and hypothalamic hypogonadism. In addition to alfacalcidol, sodium bicarbonate and oral phosphorus supplementation were initiated. After this prescription, her pain dramatically improved in association with the restoration of acid-base balance and electrolytes; renal dysfunction and proteinuria were unaltered. This case indicated that careful assessments of tubular function and acid-base balance are essential for the management of osteomalacia in addition to the evaluation of the calcium/phosphate balance and vitamin D status.</snippet>

      <title>An update on vascular calcification and potential therapeutics.</title>
      <snippet>Pathological calcification is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidities primarily in population with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage renal diseases (ERSD) and metabolic disorders. Investigators have accepted the fact that vascular calcification is not a passive process but a highly complex, cell mediated, active process in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) resulting from, metabolic insults of bone fragility, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Over the years, studies have revealed various mechanisms of vascular calcification like induction of bone formation, apoptosis, alteration in Ca-P balance and loss of inhibition. Novel clinical studies targeting cellular mechanisms of calcification provide promising and potential avenues for drug development. The interventions include phosphate binders, sodium thiosulphate, vitamin K, calcimimetics, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, Myoinositol hexaphosphate (IP6), Denosumab and TNAP inhibitors. Concurrently investigators are also working towards reversing or curing pathological calcification. This review focuses on the relationship of vascular calcification to clinical diseases, regulators and factors causing calcification including genetics which have been identified. At present, there is lack of any significant preventive measures for calcifications and hence this review explores further possibilities for drug development and treatment modalities.</snippet>

      <title>Old and New Drugs for the Management of Bone Disorders in CKD.</title>
      <snippet>Disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those undergoing dialysis. Renal osteodystrophy, which describes an alteration of bone morphology, is an important component of this systemic disorder and may explain the elevated risk of fracture which adversely affects morbidity and mortality. The most common form of renal osteodystrophy is high-turnover bone disease (osteitis fibrosa), which is induced by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). During the past decade, there has been considerable advances in the management of SHPT, with the introduction of the calcimimetic agents, the optimized use of nutritional and active vitamin D, and the accumulated experience with surgical parathyroidectomy. Studies supported that these advances could translate into improvement of renal bone disease and fracture prevention, as well as decreasing the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. In this review, we summarize the available clinical evidence on the effect of old and new drugs on bone disorders in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Prospective role of thyroid disorders in monitoring COVID-19 pandemic.</title>
      <snippet>COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 200 countries and 1.3 million individuals have deceased within eleven months. Intense research on COVID-19 occurrence and prevalence enable us to understand that comorbidities play a crucial role in spread and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic kidney disease, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension are among the various morbidities that are prevalent in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. However, the effect of altered thyroid-driven disorders cannot be ignored. Since thyroid hormone critically coordinate and regulate the major metabolism and biochemical pathways, this review is on the potential role of prevailing thyroid disorders in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Direct link of thyroid hormone with several disorders such as diabetes, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, kidney and liver disorders etc. suggests that the prevailing thyroid conditions may affect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, we discuss the oxidative stress-induced aging is associated with the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, ACE2 protein which facilitates the host-cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 using the spike protein, are highly expressed in individuals with abnormal level of thyroid hormone. Altogether, we report that the malfunction of thyroid hormone synthesis may aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus monitoring the thyroid hormone may help in understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.</snippet>

      <title>Is microvascular dysfunction a systemic disorder with common biomarkers found in the heart, brain, and kidneys? - A scoping review.</title>
      <snippet>Although microvascular dysfunction (MVD) has been well characterized in individual organs as different disease entities, clinical evidence is mounting in support of an underlying systemic process. To address this hypothesis, we systematically searched PubMed and Medline for studies in adults published between 2014 and 2019 that measured blood biomarkers of MVD in three vital organs i.e. brain, heart, and the kidney. Of the 9706 unique articles 321 met the criteria, reporting 49 biomarkers of which 16 were common to the three organs. Endothelial dysfunction, inflammation including reactive oxidation, immune activation, and coagulation were the commonly recognized pathways. Triglyceride, C-reactive protein, Cystatin C, homocysteine, uric acid, IL-6, NT-proBNP, thrombomodulin, von Willebrand Factor, and uric acid were increased in MVD of all three organs. In contrast, vitamin D was decreased. Adiponectin, asymmetric dimethylarginine, total cholesterol, high-density and low-density cholesterol were found to be variably increased or decreased in studies. We review the pathways underlying MVD in the three organs and summarize evidence supporting its systemic nature. This scoping review informs clinicians and researchers in the multi-system manifestation of MVD. Future work should focus on longitudinal investigations to evaluate the multi-system involvement of this disease.</snippet>

      <title>Vitamin D Metabolism and Its Role in Mineral and Bone Disorders in Chronic Kidney Disease in Humans, Dogs and Cats.</title>
      <snippet>Some differences regarding Vitamin D metabolism are described in dogs and cats in comparison with humans, which may be explained by an evolutionary drive among these species. Similarly, vitamin D is one of the most important regulators of mineral metabolism in dogs and cats, as well as in humans. Mineral metabolism is intrinsically related to bone metabolism, thus disturbances in vitamin D have been implicated in the development of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) in people, in addition to dogs and cats. Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with Renal Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (RSHPT), which is the most common mineral disorder in later stages of CKD in dogs and cats. Herein, we review the peculiarities of vitamin D metabolism in these species in comparison with humans, and the role of vitamin D disturbances in the development of CKD-MBD among dogs, cats, and people. Comparative studies may offer some evidence to help further research about vitamin D metabolism and bone disorders in CKD.</snippet>
