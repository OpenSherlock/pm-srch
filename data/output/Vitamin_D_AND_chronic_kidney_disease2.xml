      <title>Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 and Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.</title>
      <snippet>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased exercise capacity. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone involved in phosphate, vitamin D, and iron homeostasis, is linked to left ventricular hypertrophy and HF. We measured c-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) and intact FGF23 (iFGF23) levels and examined their associations with exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF.</snippet>

      <title>SERUM VITAMIN D LEVELS IN DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGIC FORMS OF AGE RELATED CATARACT.</title>
      <snippet>Vitamin D insufficiency and age related cataract (ARC) are public health problems. We evaluated serum vitamin D levels in ARC patients. ... A prospective hospital-based cross-sectional study was designed to measure the vitamin D status of patients with ARC. Patients have grouped either presence of any type of posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) (group 1) or ARC without the PSC component (Group 2). After full ophthalmologic consideration, patients over 40 years of age with no history of ocular trauma, multivitamin supplement ingestion, chronic renal failure, thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, skin cancer, and cigarette smoking were included in the study. ... Totally, 79 subjects of which 26 (32.9%) subjects in group 1 and 53 (67.1%) subjects in group 2 were included in the study. Group 1 had mean vitamin D levels of 17.31±13.30 ng/mL. Vitamin D levels in Group 2 were 13.34±7.87 ng/mL. Group 1 did not show vitamin D insufficiency (P = 0.31; one-sample t-test). However, Group 2 showed a statistically significantly lower vitamin D level compared to the insufficiency level of 20ng/mL (P= 0.00; one-sample t-test). ... Vitamin D may have an important function in lens metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency and cataract development need further extensive researches.</snippet>

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) level is associated with ultrafiltration rate in patients on hemodialysis.</title>
      <snippet>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that regulates renal phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D synthesis in renal proximal tubules. High circulating FGF23 levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease and those on dialysis. Current data also suggest higher circulating levels of FGF23 are associated with cardiovascular mortality, vascular calcification, and left ventricular hypertrophy; however, evidence on the role of FGF23 in patients on dialysis is incomplete, and some of the data, especially those on cardiovascular disease (CVD), are controversial. This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with FGF23 in hemodialysis patients with or without CVD. Randomly selected 76 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a single hemodialysis center were enrolled. After the exclusion of eight patients with extremely outlying FGF23 levels, 68 patients, including 48 males and 46 patients with a CVD history, were included in the study. The mean age was 64.4 ± 12.1 years, and the mean dialysis duration was 12.7 ± 7.1 years. Dialysis duration, time-averaged concentration of urea (TAC-urea), ultrafiltration rate (UFR), blood pressure during hemodialysis session, laboratory data, and echocardiographic parameters including interventricular septum thickness (IVST), left ventricular mass indices (LVMI), and ejection fraction were included in univariate and multivariate analyses. The median lgFGF23 levels in the overall cohort and in those with and without CVD were 2.14 (interquartile range, IQR - 0.43 to - 4.23), 2.01 (- 0.52 to 4.12), and 2.59 (0.07 to 4.32), respectively, and there was no difference between the patients with and without CVD (p = 0.14). The univariate analysis revealed that FGF23 was significantly associated with age (r =  - 0.12, p &lt; 0.01), duration of hemodialysis (r =  - 0.11, p &lt; 0.01), TAC-urea (r = 0.29, p = 0.01), UFR (r = 0.26, p = 0.04), alkaline phosphatase (ALP; r =  - 0.27, p = 0.03), corrected serum calcium (cCa; r = 0.32, p &lt; 0.01), serum phosphate (iP, r = 0.57, p &lt; 0.01), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH; r = 0.38, p &lt; 0.01), IVST (r = 0.30, p = 0.01), and LVMI (r = 0.26, p = 0.04). In multivariate regression analysis, FGF23 was significantly associated with cCa (F = 25.6, p &lt; 0.01), iP (F = 22.5, p &lt; 0.01), iPTH (F = 19.2, p &lt; 0.01), ALP (F = 5.34, p = 0.03), and UFR (F = 3.94, p = 0.05). In addition, the univariate analysis after the categorization of patients according to CVD indicated that FGF23 was significantly associated with cCa (r = 0.34, p = 0.02), iP (r = 0.41, p &lt; 0.01), iPTH (r = 0.39, p = 0.01), and TAC-urea (r = 0.45, p &lt; 0.01) in patients with CVD, whereas only IVST (r = 0.53, p = 0.04) was associated with FGF23 in those without CVD. FGF23 levels in hemodialysis patients were extremely high and associated not only with mineral bone disease-related factors but also with UFR. Additionally, dialysis efficacy might be associated with lower FGF23 levels in patients with CVD.</snippet>

      <title>Linking chronic kidney disease and Parkinson&apos;s disease: a literature review.</title>
      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been typically implicated in cardiovascular risk, considering the function the kidney has related to blood pressure, vitamin D, red blood cell metabolism, and electrolyte and acid-base regulation. However, neurological consequences are also attributed to this disease. Among these, recent large epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased risk for Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) in patients with CKD. Multiple studies have evaluated individually the association of blood pressure, vitamin D, and red blood cell dysmetabolism with PD, however, no study has reviewed the potential mechanisms related to these components in context of CKD and PD. In this review, we explored the association of CKD and PD and linked the components of the former to propose potential pathways explaining a future increased risk for PD, where renin-angiotensin system, oxidative stress, and inflammation have a main role. Potential preventive and therapeutic interventions based on these associations are also explored. More preclinical studies are needed to confirm the potential link of CKD conditions and future PD risk, whereas more interventional studies targeting this association are warranted to confirm their potential benefit in PD.</snippet>

      <title>Klotho, Aging, and the Failing Kidney.</title>
      <snippet>Klotho has been recognized as a gene involved in the aging process in mammals for over 30 years, where it regulates phosphate homeostasis and the activity of members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. The α-Klotho protein is the receptor for Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23), regulating phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism. Phosphate toxicity is a hallmark of mammalian aging and correlates with diminution of Klotho levels with increasing age. As such, modulation of Klotho activity is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in the diseasome of aging; in particular for chronic kidney disease (CKD), where Klotho has been implicated directly in the pathophysiology. A range of senotherapeutic strategies have been developed to directly or indirectly influence Klotho expression, with varying degrees of success. These include administration of exogenous Klotho, synthetic and natural Klotho agonists and indirect approaches, via modulation of the foodome and the gut microbiota. All these approaches have significant potential to mitigate loss of physiological function and resilience accompanying old age and to improve outcomes within the diseasome of aging.</snippet>

      <title>Control of phosphorus and prevention of fractures in the kidney patient.</title>
      <snippet>Patients with chronic kidney disease have a higher risk of fractures than the general population due to the added factor of uraemia. Although the mechanisms behind uraemia-associated fractures are not fully understood, it is widely accepted that the decrease in bone mineral content and alteration in bone architecture both increase bone fragility. As chronic kidney disease progresses, the risk of fracture increases, especially once the patient requires dialysis. Among the many causes of the increased risk are advanced age, amenorrhoea, steroid exposure, decreased vitamin D, increased parathyroid hormone (PTH), malnutrition and chronic inflammation. Serum phosphorus, whether high or very low, seems to correlate with the risk of fracture. Moreover, increased serum phosphate is known to directly and indirectly affect bone metabolism through the development of adaptive hormonal mechanisms aimed at preventing hyperphosphataemia, such as the increase in PTH and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and the reduction in calcitriol. These adaptive mechanisms are less intense if the intestinal absorption of phosphorus is reduced with the use of phosphorus captors, which seem to have a positive impact in reducing the risk of fractures. We describe here the possible mechanisms associating serum phosphorus levels, the adaptive mechanisms typical in kidney disease and the use of drugs to control hyperphosphataemia with the risk of fractures. We found no studies in the literature providing evidence on the influence of different treatments on the risk of fractures in patients with chronic kidney disease. We suggest that control of phosphorus should be an objective to consider.</snippet>

      <title>Relationship between GFR, intact PTH, oxidized PTH, non-oxidized PTH as well as FGF23 in patients with CKD.</title>
      <snippet>Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are regulators of renal phosphate excretion and vitamin D metabolism. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), circulating FGF23 and PTH concentrations progressively increase as renal function declines. Oxidation of PTH at two methionine residues (positions 8 and 18) causes a loss of function. The impact of n-oxPTH and oxPTH on FGF23 synthesis, however, and how n-oxPTH and oxPTH concentrations are affected by CKD, is yet unknown. The effects of oxidized and non-oxidized PTH 1-34 on Fgf23 gene expression were analyzed in UMR106 osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between n-oxPTH and oxPTH, respectively, with FGF23 in two independent patients&apos; cohorts (620 children with CKD and 600 kidney transplant recipients). While n-oxPTH stimulated Fgf23 mRNA synthesis in vitro, oxidation of PTH in particular at Met8 led to a markedly weaker stimulation of Fgf23. The effect was even stronger when both Met8 and Met18 were oxidized. In both clinical cohorts, n-oxPTH-but not oxPTH-was significantly associated with FGF23 concentrations, independent of known confounding factors. Moreover, with progressive deterioration of kidney function, intact PTH (iPTH) and oxPTH increased substantially, whereas n-oxPTH increased only moderately. In conclusion, n-oxPTH, but not oxPTH, stimulates Fgf23 gene expression. The increase in PTH with decreasing GFR is mainly due to an increase in oxPTH in more advanced stages of CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Osteoporosis in Patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases: A Systemic Review.</title>
      <snippet>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with the development of mineral bone disorder (MBD), osteoporosis, and fragility fractures. Among CKD patients, adynamic bone disease or low bone turnover is the most common type of renal osteodystrophy. The consequences of CKD-MBD include increased fracture risk, greater morbidity, and mortality. Thus, the goal is to prevent the occurrences of fractures by means of alleviating CKD-induced MBD and treating subsequent osteoporosis. Changes in mineral and humoral metabolism as well as bone structure develop early in the course of CKD. CKD-MBD includes abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and/or vitamin D; abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength; and/or vascular or other soft tissue calcification. In patients with CKD-MBD, using either DXA or FRAX to screen fracture risk should be considered. Biomarkers such as bALP and iPTH may assist to assess bone turnover. Before initiating an antiresorptive or anabolic agent to treat osteoporosis in CKD patients, lifestyle modifications, such as exercise, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation, smoking cessation, and avoidance of excessive alcohol intake are important. Managing hyperphosphatemia and SHPT are also crucial. Understanding the complex pathogenesis of CKD-MBD is crucial in improving one&apos;s short- and long-term outcomes. Treatment strategies for CKD-associated osteoporosis should be patient-centered to determine the type of renal osteodystrophy. This review focuses on the mechanism, evaluation and management of patients with CKD-MBD. However, further studies are needed to explore more details regarding the underlying pathophysiology and to assess the safety and efficacy of agents for treating CKD-MBD.</snippet>

      <title>Celastrol attenuates arterial and valvular calcification via inhibiting BMP2/Smad1/5 signalling.</title>
      <snippet>Vascular calcification is an important risk factor for the mortality and morbidity in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, until now there is no certain medication targeting vascular calcification in CKD. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effect of celastrol on high calcium-induced vascular calcification and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Cell proliferation assay showed that celastrol inhibited aortic valve interstitial cell (VIC) and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation when its concentration was higher than 0.6 μmol/L. 0.8 μmol/L celastrol inhibited the expression of osteogenic genes and calcium deposition induced by high-calcium medium in both AVICs and VSMCs. In mouse vascular calcification model induced by adenine combined with vitamin D, alizarin red and immunostaining showed that celastrol inhibited pro-calcification gene expression and calcium deposition in aortic wall and aortic valve tissues. At the molecular level, celastrol inhibited the increase of BMP2, phosphorylated Smad1/5 (p-Smad1/5) and non-phosphorylated β-catenin (n-p-β-catenin) induced by high-calcium medium both in vitro and in vivo. Also, BMP2 overexpression reversed the anti-calcification effects of celastrol by recovering the decrease of p-Smad1/5 and n-p-β-catenin. Furthermore, celastrol prevented the up-regulation of BMPRII and down-regulation of Smad6 induced by high calcium, and this protectory effect can be abolished by BMP2 overexpression. In conclusion, our data for the first time demonstrate that celastrol attenuates high calcium-induced arterial and valvular calcification by inhibiting BMP2/Smad1/5 signalling, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for arterial and valvular calcification in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Recent advances in understanding and managing secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease.</title>
      <snippet>Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a complex pathology that develops as chronic kidney disease progresses. The retention of phosphorus and the reductions in calcium and vitamin D levels stimulate the synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone as well as the proliferation rate of parathyroid cells. Parathyroid growth is initially diffuse but it becomes nodular as the disease progresses, making the gland less susceptible to be inhibited. Although the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism are well known, new evidence has shed light on unknown aspects of the deregulation of parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is an important feature of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder and plays an important role in the development of bone disease and vascular calcification. Thus, part of the management of chronic kidney disease relies on maintaining acceptable levels of mineral metabolism parameters in an attempt to slow down or prevent the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Here, we will also review the latest evidence regarding several aspects of the clinical and surgical management of secondary hyperparathyroidism.</snippet>

      <snippet>We report the case of a 35-year-old female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis for nine years. She was diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism complicated with a brown tumor in the mandible. After medical therapy failed, she underwent total parathyroidectomy (PTX), which was complicated by severe and prolonged hypocalcemia (hungry bone syndrome). Post-surgery, she required prolonged and frequent intravenous calcium and a high dose of vitamin D resulting in frequent admission with symptomatic hypocalcemia. Her serum magnesium was noted to be in the normal range. She continued to be hypocalcemic for nearly eight months post-surgery despite the intensive treatment. Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (teriparatide) 20 mg daily resulted in normalization of calcium within two weeks. The use of parathyroid hormone proved to be an effective treatment approach in this case. Proper pre-operative preparation and subtotal PTX with an adequate dose of vitamin D and calcium supplement may have been a rational option for this case.</snippet>
