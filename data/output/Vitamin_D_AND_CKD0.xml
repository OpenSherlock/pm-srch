      <title>Diabetes Mellitus and Renal Function: Current Medical Research and Opinion.</title>
      <snippet>Diabetes mellitus (DM) which is defined as high blood glucose level is a major public health worldwide. While discussing DM, the knowledge in this field is unlimited hence a syndrome that populations are living with for more than a decade is always an important matter to keep searching for updates on it. Challenges are always present in different means as comorbidities, poorly controlled DM especially type 2 Diabetes mellitus(T2DM) is considered as a risk factor for a lot of different diseases including but not limited to chronic kidney Disease (CKD). Complications might appear through time, as the aging process changes the body functions, while a significant number of antidiabetic medications are cleared eventually by the kidney; this increase the burden on kidney function placing the diabetic patients at risk. The significant high number of patients with uncontrolled diabetes resulting with kidney disease mirror the importance of this condition on patient&apos;s quality of life. This review presents an overview, pathophysiology, etiology and prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and abnormal renal parameters correlated with poorly controlled T2DM, with emphasis on and clinical studies involving the association between vitamin D Insufficiency/Deficiency and chronic kidney disease among patients with T2DM.</snippet>

      <title>Effects of calcitriol and paricalcitol on renal fibrosis in CKD.</title>
      <snippet>In chronic kidney Disease (CKD) the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal inflammation stimulate renal fibrosis and the progression to end-stage renal disease. The low levels of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its activators (VDRAs) contribute to worsen secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal fibrosis.</snippet>

      <title>Fibrosis in Chronic Kidney Disease: Pathogenesis and Consequences.</title>
      <snippet>Fibrosis is a process characterized by an excessive accumulation of the extracellular matrix as a response to different types of tissue injuries, which leads to organ dysfunction. The process can be initiated by multiple and different stimuli and pathogenic factors which trigger the cascade of reparation converging in molecular signals responsible of initiating and driving fibrosis. Though fibrosis can play a defensive role, in several circumstances at a certain stage, it can progressively become an uncontrolled irreversible and self-maintained process, named pathological fibrosis. Several systems, molecules and responses involved in the pathogenesis of the pathological fibrosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be discussed in this review, putting special attention on inflammation, renin-angiotensin system (RAS), parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), Klotho, microRNAs (miRs), and the vitamin D hormonal system. All of them are key factors of the core and regulatory pathways which drive fibrosis, having a great negative kidney and cardiac impact in CKD.</snippet>

      <title>An update on vascular calcification and potential therapeutics.</title>
      <snippet>Pathological calcification is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidities primarily in population with chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage renal diseases (ERSD) and metabolic disorders. Investigators have accepted the fact that vascular calcification is not a passive process but a highly complex, cell mediated, active process in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) resulting from, metabolic insults of bone fragility, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Over the years, studies have revealed various mechanisms of vascular calcification like induction of bone formation, apoptosis, alteration in Ca-P balance and loss of inhibition. Novel clinical studies targeting cellular mechanisms of calcification provide promising and potential avenues for drug development. The interventions include phosphate binders, sodium thiosulphate, vitamin K, calcimimetics, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, Myoinositol hexaphosphate (IP6), Denosumab and TNAP inhibitors. Concurrently investigators are also working towards reversing or curing pathological calcification. This review focuses on the relationship of vascular calcification to clinical diseases, regulators and factors causing calcification including genetics which have been identified. At present, there is lack of any significant preventive measures for calcifications and hence this review explores further possibilities for drug development and treatment modalities.</snippet>

      <title>Old and New Drugs for the Management of Bone Disorders in CKD.</title>
      <snippet>Disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those undergoing dialysis. Renal osteodystrophy, which describes an alteration of bone morphology, is an important component of this systemic disorder and may explain the elevated risk of fracture which adversely affects morbidity and mortality. The most common form of renal osteodystrophy is high-turnover bone disease (osteitis fibrosa), which is induced by secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). During the past decade, there has been considerable advances in the management of SHPT, with the introduction of the calcimimetic agents, the optimized use of nutritional and active vitamin D, and the accumulated experience with surgical parathyroidectomy. Studies supported that these advances could translate into improvement of renal bone disease and fracture prevention, as well as decreasing the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. In this review, we summarize the available clinical evidence on the effect of old and new drugs on bone disorders in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Vitamin D Metabolism and Its Role in Mineral and Bone Disorders in Chronic Kidney Disease in Humans, Dogs and Cats.</title>
      <snippet>Some differences regarding Vitamin D metabolism are described in dogs and cats in comparison with humans, which may be explained by an evolutionary drive among these species. Similarly, vitamin D is one of the most important regulators of mineral metabolism in dogs and cats, as well as in humans. Mineral metabolism is intrinsically related to bone metabolism, thus disturbances in vitamin D have been implicated in the development of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) in people, in addition to dogs and cats. Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with Renal Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (RSHPT), which is the most common mineral disorder in later stages of CKD in dogs and cats. Herein, we review the peculiarities of vitamin D metabolism in these species in comparison with humans, and the role of vitamin D disturbances in the development of CKD-MBD among dogs, cats, and people. Comparative studies may offer some evidence to help further research about vitamin D metabolism and bone disorders in CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Circulating Levels of Dickkopf-Related Protein 1 Decrease as Measured GFR Declines and Are Associated with PTH Levels.</title>
      <snippet>The Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway has been implicated in the development of adynamic bone disease in early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) and sclerostin are antagonists of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway yet have not been widely used as clinical indicators of bone disease. This study characterized levels of DKK1, sclerostin, and other biomarkers of mineral metabolism in participants across a spectrum of inulin-measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). ... GFR was measured by urinary inulin clearance (mGFR) in 90 participants. Blood samples were obtained for measurement of circulating DKK1, sclerostin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphate, Î±-klotho, and vitamin D metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Spearman correlations and linear regressions were used where appropriate to examine the associations between measured values. ... The median [IQR] age was 64 years [53.0-71.0], and the median [IQR] mGFR was 32.6 [21.7-60.6] mL/min. DKK1 decreased (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.001) and sclerostin increased (r = -0.4, p &lt; 0.001) as kidney function declined, and both were associated with phosphate, PTH, FGF-23, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the unadjusted analysis. After adjustment for age and mGFR, DKK1 remained significantly associated with PTH. ... The results of this study demonstrate opposing trends in Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway inhibitors, DKK1 and sclerostin, as mGFR declines. Unlike sclerostin, DKK1 levels decreased significantly as mGFR declined and was independently associated with PTH. Future studies should determine whether measurement of Wnt signaling inhibitors may be useful in predicting bone histomorphometric findings and important clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.</snippet>

      <title>New Aspects of the Kidney in the Regulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) and Mineral Homeostasis.</title>
      <snippet>The bone-derived hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) acts in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the active vitamin D metabolite calcitriol in the regulation of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) homeostasis. More factors are being identified to regulate FGF23 levels and the endocrine loops between the three hormones. The present review summarizes the complex regulation of FGF23 and the disturbed FGF23/Klotho system in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to the reduced ability of the injured kidney to regulate plasma levels of FGF23, several CKD-related factors have been shown to stimulate FGF23 production. The high circulating FGF23 levels have detrimental effects on erythropoiesis, the cardio-vascular system and the immune system, all contributing to the disturbed system biology in CKD. Moreover, new factors secreted by the injured kidney and the uremic calcified vasculature play a role in the mineral and bone disorder in CKD and create a vicious pathological crosstalk.</snippet>

      <title>Design and development of FGF-23 antagonists: Definition of the pharmacophore and initial structure-activity relationships probed by synthetic analogues.</title>
      <snippet>Hereditary hypophosphatemic disorders, TIO, and CKD conditions are believed to be influenced by an excess of Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF-23) which activates a binary renal FGFRs / Î±-Klotho complex to regulate homeostatic metabolism of phosphate and vitamin D. Adaptive FGF-23 responses from CKD patients with excess FGF-23 frequently lead to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease. A reversibly binding small molecule therapeutic has yet to emerge from research and development in this area. Current outcomes described in this work highlight efforts related to lead identification and modification using organic synthesis of strategic analogues to probe structure-activity relationships and preliminarily define the pharmacophore of a computationally derived hit obtained from virtual high-throughput screening. Synthetic strategies for the initial hit and analogue preparation, as well as preliminary cellular in vitro assay results highlighting sub micromolar inhibition of the FGF-23 signaling sequence at a concentration well below cytotoxicity are reported herein.</snippet>

      <title>Fibroblast growth factor 23-Klotho and hypertension: experimental and clinical mechanisms.</title>
      <snippet>Hypertension (HTN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly recognized in pediatric patients and represent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. In CKD, enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption is a leading cause of HTN due to augmented extracellular fluid volume expansion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) upregulates various tubular sodium cotransporters that are also targets of the hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and its co-receptor Klotho. FGF23 inhibits the activation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D that is a potent suppressor of renin biosynthesis. Here we review the complex interactions and disturbances of the FGF23-Klotho axis, vitamin D, and the RAAS relevant to blood pressure regulation and discuss the therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating their pathophysiologic contributions to HTN.</snippet>

      <title>Impaired arterial vitamin D signaling occurs in the development of vascular calcification.</title>
      <snippet>Conflicting data exists as to whether vitamin D receptor agonists (VDRa) are protective of arterial calcification. Confounding this, is the inherent physiological differences between human and animal experimental models and our current fragmented understanding of arterial vitamin D metabolism, their alterations in disease states and responses to VDRa&apos;s. Herein, the study aims to address these problems by leveraging frontiers in human arterial organ culture models. Human arteries were collected from a total of 24 patients (healthy controls, n = 12; end-stage CKD, n = 12). Cross-sectional and interventional studies were performed using arterial organ cultures treated with normal and calcifying (containing 5mmol/L CaCl2 and 5mmol/L Î²-glycerophosphate) medium, ex vivo. To assess the role of VDRa therapy, arteries were treated with either calcitriol or paricalcitol. We found that human arteries express a functionally active vitamin D system, including the VDR, 1Î±-hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase (24-OHase) components and these were dysregulated in CKD arteries. VDRa therapy increased VDR expression in healthy arteries (p&lt;0.01) but not in CKD arteries. Arterial 1Î±-OHase (p&lt;0.05) and 24-OHase mRNA and protein expression were modulated differentially in healthy and CKD arteries by VDRa therapy. VDRa exposure suppressed Runx2 and MMP-9 expression in CKD arteries, however only paricalcitol suppressed MMP-2. VDRa exposure did not modulate arterial calcification in all organ culture models. However, VDRa reduced expression of senescence associated Î²-galactosidase (SAÎ²G) staining in human aortic-smooth muscle cells under calcifying conditions, in vitro. In conclusion, maladaptation of arterial vitamin D signaling components occurs in CKD. VDRa exposure can exert vasculo-protective effects and seems critical for the regulation of arterial health in CKD.</snippet>

      <title>Maxacalcitol (22-Oxacalcitriol (OCT)) Retards Progression of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy with Renal Dysfunction Through Inhibition of Calcineurin-NFAT Activity.</title>
      <snippet>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a cardiovascular complication highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Previous studies analyzing 1Î±-hydroxylase or vitamin D receptor (Vdr) knockout mice revealed active vitamin D as a promising agent inhibiting LVH progression. Paricalcitol, an active vitamin D analog, failed to suppress the progression of LV mass index (LVMI) in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. As target genes of activated VDR differ depending on its agonists, we examined the effects of maxacalcitol (22-oxacalcitriol: OCT), a less calcemic active vitamin D analog, on LVH in hemodialysis patients and animal LVH models with renal insufficiency.</snippet>
